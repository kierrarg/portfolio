# Important!

## This project is undergoing renovations


This project was created with backend functionality using MSSQL and Node.js linking to the contact page, however, in order to deploy it through Github pages I needed to comment out the backend code. The commented out code can be found in 

```server.js```
```dbfiles/```
```components/Contact/Contact.js```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

With the backend code uncommented you can run:

### `npm start server`
